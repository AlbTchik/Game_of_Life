# The Conway Game of Life
It's a great pleseaure to introduce you to the tha Game of Life code that I made during my first Engineering year at ESILV, it shows a quite astounding emergence of complex behavior when using only simple rules.

You can choose between multiple starting position and number of population.

An example of the Option 5 after some iterations :
![5 - Canon de Gosper](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90097422/174498452-e83da662-8cba-4230-b91a-8785e8765526.JPG)
Which represent the Gosper Cannon, a well known form in Game of Life 

Generated by this starting configuration : 
![5 - Canon de Gosper Init](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90097422/174501294-dbaab751-6a99-4f39-85c4-c2575dc273a0.JPG)


Here is what you can find in the Start Option 3 :
![3 - Vaisseau de l'Oie](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90097422/174501300-6923c16f-e77d-44bc-89bf-ed38ec33fdbc.gif =1920x1080)
The Goose Vessel !!!


An then you can also see an example with multiple population sharing the space
