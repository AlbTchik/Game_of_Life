# Game_of_Life
I made this code during my first Engineering year at ESILV, it shows a quite astounding emergence of complex behavior when using only simple rules.

An example of the Start Option 5 :
![5 - Canon de Gosper](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90097422/174498452-e83da662-8cba-4230-b91a-8785e8765526.JPG)
Which represent the Gosper Cannon, a well known form in Game of Life

Here is what you can find in the Start Option 3 :
![3 - Vaisseau de l'Oie](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90097422/174498797-30ec056c-c144-4374-9cec-44dd88cc8469.gif)
The Goose Vessel !!!
