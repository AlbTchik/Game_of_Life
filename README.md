# The Conway Game of Life
It's a great pleseaure to introduce you to the tha Game of Life code that I made during my first Engineering year at ESILV, it shows a quite astounding emergence of complex behavior when using only simple rules.

You can choose between multiple starting position and number of population.

An example of the Start Option 5 :

Which represent the Gosper Cannon, a well known form in Game of Life

Here is what you can find in the Start Option 3 :
