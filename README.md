# The Conway Game of Life
It's a great pleseaure to introduce you to the tha Game of Life code that I made during my first Engineering year at ESILV, it shows a quite astounding emergence of complex behavior when using only simple rules.

You can choose between multiple starting position and number of population.

An example of the Start Option 5 :
![5 - Canon de Gosper](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90097422/174498452-e83da662-8cba-4230-b91a-8785e8765526.JPG)
Which represent the Gosper Cannon, a well known form in Game of Life

Here is what you can find in the Start Option 3 :
![3 - Vaisseau de l'Oie](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90097422/174499598-a2c09eff-9356-4075-9d3a-103b1a684320.gif)

The Goose Vessel !!!

An then you can also see an example with multiple population sharing the space
